Lesson 2 : Led Button

Greeting Amazing Reader,

In this lesson we learn about how to turn on or off led from button trigger. 
The ide of this lesson is how t change the state of the led when the button was triggered. To realized that, we need signal to tell the current state od the led. When the button was triggered, then current state od led will be change to the next state which the next state is opposite the current state.
However, on FPGA we need to detect the button state over the led current state. The button state tell us what the button status at the time.

I do my best to tell about this lesson. I hope you can learn something about this lesson.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Rizka Reza Pahlevi.
